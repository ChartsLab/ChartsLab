For example, you can create Axis elements using ChartsLab-Axis and style them with easy to use functionality and add to them some Points from ChartsLab-Shape and congrates you make a Scatter plot. You can use composite filter effects, dashed strokes and clipping. If browser vendors introduce new features tomorrow, you’ll be able to use them immediately—no toolkit update required.
